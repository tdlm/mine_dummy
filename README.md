# mine_dummy
Mine Dummy (Minesweeper clone in JS)

## Todos:

- Convert from HTML Table to Canvas
- Add difficulty setting like Dave's has
- Add "win" and "lose" screens
- Change images for mines/flags to custom SVGs
- Fancy up the buttons
- Fancy up the squares?
- Clean up usage disparity between X, Y coordinates and Tile objects in code

Disclaimer: I have made this rudimentary version of Minesweeper in a coding style much borrowed from
@gabrielecirulli's version of 2048 (https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048). The gaming logic was
determined almost entirely by observing David Carr's version of the game
(http://retrozephyr.com/games.php?id=Mine%20Find) and asking him tons of annoying, but hopefully fun,
questions.

I fully admit to having Googled for the images I've used here. As I'm not making a profit on them in
any capacity, I thought the fair thing to do would be full disclosure here. If anyone wishes me to
remove these images, I will gladly do so.
