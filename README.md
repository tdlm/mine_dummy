Mine Dummy (Minesweeper clone in JS)

## Todos:

- Add flag counter
- Add difficulty setting like Dave's has
- Add "win" and "lose" screens
- Fancy up the buttons
- Fancy up the squares?

Disclaimer: I have made this rudimentary version of Minesweeper in a coding style much borrowed from
@gabrielecirulli's version of 2048 (https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).
